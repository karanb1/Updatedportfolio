            tend to lean into user facing projects which involves highly
            interactive and dynamic user experience. I believe that design and
            technology can make a great impact in lives of millions of people
            and I experienced that when I worked on{" "}

            currently use the React ecosystem to create pixel perfect UI
            components for web and mobile applications. Previously, I've had the
            opportunity to work with the amazing teams at{" "}

            learned about ownership, working in a collaborative environment and
            how to approach complex real world problems. When I am not coding you
            can find me travelling the world, listening to music, playing
            cricket or playing mobile games.
