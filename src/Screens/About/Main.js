            Hey there, I'm Karan! I am a senior year student pursuing bachelors
            in Infromation Technology at Maharaja Surajmal Institute located in
            new delhi, India. I am currently working as a Software development Engineer at{" "}
            <span className="text-red-500 font-semibold">Spinny</span>, India‚Äôs most trusted used car brand and is on its way to become a unicorn
            . I am passionate about creating easy to use products and I mostly
            tend to lean into user facing projects which involves highly
            interactive and dynamic user experience. I believe that design and
            technology can make a great impact in lives of millions of people
            and I experienced that when I worked on{" "}

            <span className="text-primary font-semibold">BBC World</span> and{" "}
            <span className="text-primary font-semibold">CNBC</span>. I
            currently use the React ecosystem to create pixel perfect UI
            components for web and mobile applications. Previously, I've had the
            opportunity to work with the amazing team at{" "}

            <span className="text-yellow-400 font-semibold">COOX</span> where I
            learned about ownership, working in a collaborative environment and
            how to approach complex real life problems. When I am not coding you
            can find me travelling the world, listening to music, playing
            cricket or playing mobile games.
